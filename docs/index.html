	<h1> Welcome to my InfoSec journey</h1>

	<p>I'm still deciding what framework/s I'll be using to develop this site </p>
	<p> I'll get to that soon... I hope </p>

	<p> This will include thoughts on all things blue, red, and purple team as well as articles and other resources </p>

	<p>Right now my goals are</p>

	<li>
		<td>CiSA+</td>
		<td>CCNA</td>
	</li>

	<p>Resource I'm using for testing and practicing</p>

	<li>
		<td>Try Hack Me</td>
		<td>Hack The Box</td>
		<td>Blue Team Labs Online</td>
	</li>

	I'll add also all links to social media and LinkedIn here 

	<i> See you all later... </i>
